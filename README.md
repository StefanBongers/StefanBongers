## Programming skills / history
Started programming with 14 thanks to my dad. Always developed software for my own fun. In 2023 I had much time so I decided to start a big project: developing a software for birg ringing stations to manage ringnumbers and storing biometrical data of the ringed birds. Including functions to reduce mistakes and helping to make the data input smooth and comfy :). The software used so far was created in 1995 in Fortran - only working on a WinNT virtual machine ... not to mention a really outdated WYSIWYG and handling.

### Languages:
`Basic, Pascal, C, C++, HTML, Python`

## anything else?
If I am not programming I try to spend time with my kids. If possible I spend time to watch, count or ring birds ðŸ¦… - this is my biggest passion.

Each friday I am chasing a frisbee during Ultimate Frisbee Training with my mates from "Eelectrics"!
